<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello there, my name is Ivan and this is my introduction page.</p>
<p>I'm from Russia. I have been studying at LaGuardia since 2021, majoring in programming and software development.<br> 
I have experience with programming languages before. Also, a few years ago I created a site for my classmate using joomla, but recently closed it due to being unused.<br> 
I also learned a little about wordpress.</p>
